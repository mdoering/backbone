# GBIF backbone in files
The [GBIF Backbone taxonomy][nub] put into GitHub as a filesystem based taxonomy with one folder per taxon.
Every folder is named after the canonical name of the taxon and contains 2 files:

README.md
: A simple human readable overview of the taxon

data.json
: A json file representing the NameUsage as retrieved from the GBIF API, for example Bufo bufo: http://api.gbif.org/v0.9/species/5217160

The folder hierarchy in the filesystem exactly represents the taxonomic classification.


### Export code
The files have been generated by a small experimental java class [NubGitExporter.java][exporter] which is part of the GBIF Checklist Bank project.

### Known bugs
The backbone version hosted here has the following known bugs, reviewed in this [blog post][blog]:
 * Animalia and Plantae are not populated because git was soooo slow
 * Synonyms and infraspecific taxa are erroneously mapped to the same folder as their accepted species, thereby overwriting the real species information
